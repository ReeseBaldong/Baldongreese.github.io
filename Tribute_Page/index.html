        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Ms. Sendler's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>February 15, 1910</strong> - Born in Warsaw, Poland</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1917</strong> - Her father, a doctor, died during the typhus epidemic,
            leaving a lasting impression on Irena about the importance of helping others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1932</strong> - Pursued a degree in Polish literature and then later switched
            to social work, earning her degree from the university of Warsaw. Began working as a social
            worker, focusing on aiding families and children in need, regardless of religion or background.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1939</strong> - Germany invaded poland and still continued her social work, joining the Polish
            underground resistance movement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1940</strong> - Sendler, along with a network of colleagues, began organizing efforts to rescue
            Jewish children from the ghetto. Used her position as social worker to gain access to the ghetto under the 
            guise of conducting inspection to prevent the spread of disease.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1942</strong> - Became a key member of the Zegota organization, a Polish underground resistance group
            focused on aiding Jews. She led the children's section of Zegota, which specialized in rescuing Jewish children.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1942</strong> - Smuggled children out of the ghetto in various ways, including through sewers, secret passage,
            and hiding them in bags and boxes. Once outside the ghetto, the children were placed with Polish families, orphanages, or
            convents, assuming new identities to hide their Jewish heritage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1942</strong> - Despite the risk, she continued her efforts and was estimated that her network rescued around 2,500
            Jewish children, risking their own lives to do so. Sendler kept records of the children's identities, hoping to one day reunite
            them with their families. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1943</strong> - Sendler was arrested by the Gestapo and brutally interrogated. Despite facing torture, she refused to
            betray her colleagues or the children she rescued. she was sentenced to death but managed to escape execution due to bribes
            paid by Zegota members.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1945</strong> - After the war, Sendler worked tirelessly to reunite Jewish children with their families. Tragically,
            many of the children's parents had been killed in the holocaust. Sendler continued her social work, aiding survivors and 
            adavocating for human rights.
          </li>
          <li>

          <li><strong>2007</strong> - She was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Although she did not win, her legacy lives on as a symbol
