            HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language is the standard language used to create and design web pages on the internet. 
            HTML provides a structured way to organize content on a webpage by using systems of tags like "<>" symbols. These tags define 
            various elements of the webpage such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more. Each HTML tag serves a specific 
            purpose and tells the web browser how to display the content in contains. 
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, a basic HTML document typically starts with an opening "html" tag, followed by a "head" section containing metadata like the page title
            and links to external sources such as stylesheets or scripts. A "body" section where the main context of the webpage resides. Within the body section,
            you can include various tags to structure you content like: <br>
              <ul>
                <li><b> "h1" </b>for headings <br></li>
                <li><b> "p" </b>for paragraphs <br></li>
                <li><b> "img" </b>for images <br></li>
                <li><b> "a" </b>for links <br></li>
                <li><b> "ul" </b>for unordered lists <br></li>
                <li><b> "form" </b>for input forms</li> 
            </ul>
        
              HTML is not a programming language but rather a markup language, meaning it focuses on defining the structure and layout of a webpage rather than implementing
              logic or algorithms. It acts as the foundation upon which web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari to render and display the content to users.
              When you create an HTML document, you're essentially providing instructions to the browser on how to present the information to visitors, ensuring consistency
              and compatibility across different platforms and devices.

            CSS which stands for Cascading Stylesheet is another crucial component in web development, often used in conjunction with HTML. While HTML provides the structure
            and content of a webpage, CSS enhances its appearance and layout by applying styles and formatting.  
          </p>

          <p>
            CSS operates on a rule-based system, where each rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector identifies which HTML elements the rule implies to,
            while the declaration block contains one or more property value pairs separated by semicolons. CSS offers a wide range of selectors, allowing developers to target 
            elements based on their type, class, ID, attributes, or even their relationship with other elements in the HTML document. CSS also supports inheritance and cascading,
            which are fundamental concepts that styles applied to parent elements are automatically inherited by their child elements unless explicitly overridden.

          <li>launch you text editor and create a new file and save it with a ".html" extension.

          <li>Inside your HTML file, you can start writing your HTML code to structure the content of your webpage.
            You can begin with changing the title or putting some content int the body like "h1" or "p" tags to start
            your sentences or phrases.</li>
          <li>If you want to add CSS styling to your HTML document, create a enw file in your text editor and save it with a ".css" extension.
            for example, you could name it "style.css"</li>
